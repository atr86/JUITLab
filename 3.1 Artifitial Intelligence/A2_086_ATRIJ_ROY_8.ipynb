        "## Minimax Algorithm\n",
        "\n",
        "The minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in game theory and artificial intelligence for choosing the optimal move for a player assuming the opponent is also playing optimally. It's a recursive algorithm that explores the game tree, evaluating possible moves and their outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this implementation, the `minimax` function evaluates the board state at different depths of the game tree.\n",
        "- If the computer wins, it returns a positive score (higher for earlier wins).\n",
        "- If the human wins, it returns a negative score (lower for earlier wins).\n",
        "- If it's a draw, it returns 0.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `find_best_move` function uses the `minimax` function to evaluate all possible moves for the computer and chooses the move that results in the highest score (assuming the human player will play optimally to minimize the computer's score).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Functions Used\n",
        "\n",
        "- `check_win(board, player)`: Checks if the given `player` has won the game on the current `board`.\n",
        "- `check_draw(board)`: Checks if the game is a draw on the current `board`.\n",
        "- `get_available_moves(board)`: Returns a list of empty cells (available moves) on the `board`.\n",
        "- `minimax(board, player, depth)`: Implements the recursive minimax algorithm to evaluate board states and return a score.\n",
        "- `find_best_move(board, computer_player)`: Finds the optimal move for the `computer_player` using the `minimax` function.\n",
        "- `get_human_move(board)`: Prompts the human player for their move, validates the input, and returns the chosen cell coordinates.\n",
        "- `display_board(board)`: Displays the current state of the `board` to the console.\n",

        "\n",
        "- `input.txt`: This file is used to optionally load an initial state of the Tic-Tac-Toe board. Each line in the file represents a row, with '-' representing an empty cell, 'X' representing a human player's move, and 'O' representing a computer player's move. This allows for starting a game from a specific point.\n",
        "- `output.txt`: This file records the progress of the game. It logs the turns of both the human and computer players, displays the board state after each move, and indicates the final outcome of the game (win, loss, or draw)."
